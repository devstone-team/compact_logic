Compact Logic is a mod that basically shrinks complicated redstone things into a single block.
AND gates, OR gates, XOR gates, and more inside a single block.
The block presents the user with an easy to use command system that can be programmed by the user
to do things. A good example is:
OUT up IF left AND right
This is a simple AND gate which will output it's signal up on the block if the left and right
sides of the block are active. There is so much more that can be explored with this mod!
